                <h2>Four Tectonic Plates</h2>
                <p>
                    Japan lies at the intersection of four tectonic plates:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Eurasian Plate</li>
                    <li>Okhotsk Plate</li>
                    <li>Pacific Plate</li>
                    <li>Philippine Plate</li>
                </ul>
                <img src="japan-tectonic-map.jpg" alt="Map of Japan's tectonic plates.">
                <p>
                    These plates are responsible for forming much of the mountainous islands that make up 
                    japan. They are also responsible for frequent earthquakes and their resulting tsunamis. 
                    However, this has given the region a rich amount of resources. There is a little bit of 
                    almost every metal and mineral in the country, including diamonds.

                <h2>Wide Variety Of Climates</h2>
                <p>
                    The vertical orientation of the country as well as its many mountains means the climate 
                    varies throughout the country. From deserts and frigid alpine areas, to idyllic beaches and 
                    temperate rain-forests, there are an astonishing amount of biomes. This, combined with its 
                    nature as a collection of isolated islands has let it to be a hotbed of biodiversity. There 
                    are <a href=”https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wildlife_of_Japan”>a large amount of species 
                    found only here.</a>
