                <p>
                    Japan is well known in the west, despite being an island country sitting far to the east. 
                    It has a reputation for being a clean, beautiful place with natural wonders and rich 
                    culture and history. People see it as technologically advanced at the same time as being a 
                    place where ancient traditions and cultures are still being kept alive. This is all 
                    more-or-less true. However, why is it that everyone is aware of all of this? Why are people 
                    in the west so familiar with a string of islands so far away?

                <h2>Why Does Everyone Like Japan?</h2>
                <p>
                    Everyone in the west seems to be fond of Japan. Japanese iconography like ramen, cherry 
                    blossom trees, kimono, and tori gates are immediately recognizable, even to people who have 
                    never paid much attention to the country. Japanese culture has gradually soaked into the 
                    West, from the proliferation of Japanese media like anime and manga, to the increasing 
                    number of schools that are teaching its language. Simply put, Japan has that X-factor that 
                    people can’t find anywhere else. Part of it is people’s fascination with the exotic, but it 
                    goes deeper than that. Japan is simply unlike most other countries.

                <h2>One-of-a-Kind Properties</h2>
                <p>
                    Japan is even unique among most Asian countries. Some properties include:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>It is very old.</li>
                    <li>Has remained mostly isolated for much of its history.</li>
                    <li>Is situated on a vertical string of islands.</li>
                    <li>Is wedged between four tectonic plates.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    This has led to a wide diversity of 
                    climates, resources, cultures, ways of life, and indeed perspectives. It is less one 
                    unified country, and more a grouping of many diverse cultures that became one over 
                    a long period of time. All of these aspects have led to it having not just a unique 
                    identity, but having a little bit of everything.
