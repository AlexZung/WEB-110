                <h2>Harmony Of The Group</h2>
                <p>
                    Japan's culture was influenced greatly by its natural disasters. It is thought that the 
                    frequent earthquakes and tsunamis fostered a desire to uphold the harmony of the group. 
                    It's hard to rebuild if everyone is quarreling with each other, after all. The pressure to 
                    not cause inconvenience for others and to self-sacrifice for the good of the community is 
                    omnipresent in Japan, from work culture to depictions of heroes. Once you are aware of it 
                    you start to see it everywhere.

                <h2>Fluid Spiritualism</h2>
                <p>
                    Religious practice in Japan is unique, in that most Japanese people would not say they are 
                    religious, while at the same time going to pray at Shinto shrines and holding Buddhist 
                    funerals. There is a casual, more practical attitude towards religion. It is not thought of 
                    in the same way as in the west, where religion is a very strict set of beliefs and practices. 
                    Japanese people will mix together beliefs and traditions from many different religions, something 
                    known as "syncretism."

                <h2>An Old Country</h2>
                <p>
                    The older a country is, the more history and traditions it accumulates, and Japan is no 
                    different. The first known habitation of the region dates back to 36,000 BC. Many tribes, 
                    cultures, and countries existed in the place now called Japan. Many wars and changing 
                    borders occurred, but in 1600 the country was unified by the Tokugawa shogunate. This 
                    started the Edo Period, where probably most of the iconic myths and traditions of Japan that you 
                    have heard of were born. 
                    It was during this time that Japan enacted a policy of isolation that lasted 220 years.

                <h2>Isolation</h2>
                <p>
                    Due to being mostly isolated, Japan was not altered much by outside forces. It gave the country 
                    freedom to establish its own unique 
                    customs and world views. This is not a luxury every country has been afforded throughout 
                    history. Oftentimes countries will pressure the other countries within their sphere of 
                    influence to be more like them, whether through simple osmosis or through colonialism and 
                    religious prosecution. However, this policy allowed Japan to escape outside influence for 
                    quite a long time. It did not last forever though.

                <h2>Forceful Opening Of The Country</h2>
                <p>
                    On March 31, 1854, the Convention of Kanagawa was signed between Japan and the United 
                    States. It was a treaty that effectively ended Japanâ€™s policy of national seclusion, and 
                    opened its borders for trade. It had been a culmination of rising tensions between the two 
                    countries. Japan did not want to open, but the United States wanted to trade and was 
                    willing to force them with military might. In the end the USA got its way, and it ushered 
                    in a new era of imperialism for Japan. However, the rulers of Japan made an intentional 
                    effort to preserve traditional structures, artifacts, and practices even as the country 
                    modernized. May of these still persist to this day.
